Return the preferred element type for a problem. This is used for buffers and interim
quantities, and should allow for enough precision even with input/output arrays that
have less.

The default is `Float64`.

Return `nothing`. See [`implicit_residuals!`](@ref), which implements ``g`` above.

Calculate the implicit residuals ``r = g(x, y)``, overwriting `r`.

Return `nothing`.

```julia

$(FUNCTIONNAME)(r, implicit_problem, x, y)

the residuals `r` are “approximately” zero, but this is not checked.

$(SIGNATURES) → (; buffer_y1, buffer_y2, buffer_y3)

Return an object which contains the following buffers, which are accessible as
properties. Each is a vector, with lengths consistent with the corresponding dimension
in [`get_dimensions`](@ref).

- `buffer_r`, `buffer_r2`: has length `n_r`
- `buffer_x`: has length `n_x`
- `buffer_y`: has length `n_y`

The fallback method reallocates these for each use, implementations can provide shared
buffers but they are guaranteed to be task-local.

The element type of buffers should be consistent with [`get_preferred_eltype`](@ref).
